          <h1 class="main-head">Our Top 3 Logo Design Pro-tips<br></h1>
          <p class="subheading">We all have a bank of memorized logos in our minds–the big names that we recognize at the quickest glance. This, of course, is not an accident. Any good logo is created with thought and purpose. It is made to be recognizable and iconic. A logo is more than an eye-catching symbol; it represents everything your brand is about. Since it will appear on every product, advertisement, business card, website, and social media channel you use, the main elements cannot be overlooked. That’s why we are sharing our top 5 logo design pro-tips.</p>
          <h1 class="head">1. Kept it simple.<br></h1>
          <p class="subheading">Although a logo represents everything included in a brand, it does not need to be complicated. It is a symbol of identity that immediately connects the viewer with your brand. It should be easily recognizable without too much information to process in a glance. A masterfully-done logo is complex in the creation of the design, but simple and memorable in the execution.</p>
          <h1 class="head">2. Know Your Audience.<br></h1>
          <p class="subheading">Every business has a target market; your logo should speak to that audience. What other kinds of products attract your target market? What do those logos look like? You want to be unique, but you need to stay focused on what kind of look will attract the customers you want. Know what they like, and they will gravitate toward you.</p>
          <h1 class="head">3. Use Color Wisely.<br></h1>
          <p class="subheading">Research has shown that colors can make us think and feel a certain way. Your logo color should inspire the right feel of your company while matching the type of product you offer. Again, consider your target audience and the color schemes that connect with them. Along those lines, the use of white space can also affect the feel of a logo. It can bring balance and calm to a collection of colorful design.</p>
